    "Deep learning networks tend to be massive with dozens or hundreds of layers, that's where the term \"deep\" comes from. You can build one of these deep networks using only weight matrices as we did in the previous notebook, but in general it's very cumbersome and difficult to implement. PyTorch has a nice module `nn` that provides a nice way to efficiently build large neural networks."
